After reading textbook excerpts, lecture notes, and segments from modules 1 and 2 I have gained knowlede and infomation concerning interpersonal communcation with familly, friends, acquaintances, and romantic relationships.I understand how of an imoprtance that percerption plays in communcatating effectively. For instance when we are exchangeing thoughts and opinions with frieds or family it tends to be in an more informal setting, without distractions like physical noise at work that can come from machinery and coworkers talking. Or in a outside environment with noise from vehicles, thunder,animals, and etc. Also in this informal setting we put ourselves at ease, usually within groups with similar politicial ideologies, religious beliefs, and or cultural norms. Additional i learned about semantic noise which is language that could be misunderstood and misinterpreted by someones accent, or tone in voice and body language that isn't familiar.
